# Future Enhancements #

This is a list of features I hope to implement at some point
  * option to use comics.org Grand Comic Database instead of ComicVine (need an api or a screen scraper to do this)
  * if a filename only has one number in it, assume it's the issue number
  * option to skip issues that already have metadata.
  * option to control different levels of error logging.  0 would be no logging.  1 would be just filenames.  2 would be filename and an error message.
  * option to control the amount of output shown.  0 would be none.  1 would be the default (what is shown now).  The higher the number, the more debug info the user would see.
