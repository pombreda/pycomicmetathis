= Future Enhancements  =

This is a list of features I hope to implement at some point
  * option to use comics.org Grand Comic Database instead of ComicVine (need an api or a screen scraper to do this)
  * if a filename only has one number in it, assume it's the issue number
  * option to skip issues that already have metadata.
  

= Contributions =

Let me know if you would be interested in helping to implement any of these features or other features you'd like to see added.
